# my installing steps for aider.chat and groq.com

remark: i have a windows machine.

## already installed a old python version ?

remark: i had already installed a old python version

first i uninstall this old version

and: later on my installation i had problems with installing pipx

later I got this error message:

'No Python at ...' then

here the tip: 

first remove directory C:\Users\<username>\.local\pipx

## install python latest release

install from https://www.python.org/

after that in the System / Apps / Installed Apps

you will find Python and Phyton Launcher

each in its latest Version

## install pipx

this to have a isolated installation of aider-chat

https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/

https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#on-windows

in a git bash in your project working dir

(may replace py with python)

```
py -m pip install --user pipx
// now a warning is displayed: pipx is not in the path
// change to this installation dir of the warning message
// if installed from python.org
cd ~/AppData/Roaming/Python/Python312/Scripts
// or if installed from Microsoft Store
cd C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_xxx\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\Scripts
// this add this directory to the environment variable PATH
pipx.exe ensurepath
```

try if pipx.exe work now

may you can check your environment variable PATH,

it should have a entry to the Scripts directory,

and in this directory there should be pipx.exe

in a new git bash
```
// show all installations with pipx, current a empty list
pipx.exe list
```

## install aider with pipx

in a new git bash
```
// runs about 1 min
pipx.exe install aider-chat
// show installed aider-chat and some additional infos about some directories
pipx.exe list
```
